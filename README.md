The A\* Pathfinding Algorithm (here A\*) is a pathfinding algorithm which is highly efficient and quite easy to implement. It is not able to handle dynamic environments but handles static situations with ease.

This project is a visualization of this algorithm and is meant to explain its progression and how it handles different problems.

You are free do download / fork this project and modify it for your needs, I would really appreciate it if you let me know of any projects which use this illustration.
